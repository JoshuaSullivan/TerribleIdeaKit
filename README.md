#TerribleIdeaKit#
===============

A living collection of my worst ideas for iOS development.

##Party Mode##
Basic - Change the background color of a view to a random, high-saturation color.
Egregious - `discoInferno` will apply party mode to all of its child views, recursively... every 0.25 seconds.

##Spinterface##
Basic - Apply a UIInterpolatingMotionEffect to the view that causes it to rotate around the selected axis.
Egregious - `spinpocalypse` will apply the selected spinterface type to the view and all of its child views.

##Jumbler##
Coming soon - Jumble the characters of any string display view!
